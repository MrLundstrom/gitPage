<h1>Container</h1>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
    a 'container' is used to center your content, and to set a max-width of your
    content. It should be placed at
    top-level. A
    regular container has a max width of 960px and is centered, and then shrinks to
    fit smaller sizes when needed. A
    'flex-container' always maximizes its width to fit your device. You can put
    anything inside a container.
